SECTION 
User Stories

A user opens the page and is greeted with a Home page.  The user can either flip through random memes or they can sign up or log in through a nav button.  

The signup page includes a form to take a username, password, and password verification (possibly email).  Once a user is signed up, they are prompted to log in. Log in form includes an input for username and password.  

Once logged in, a user can either post links to new memes or follow other users to curate a "Meme Stream" on their profile.  

From the post page, a user is asked to add a link to the meme and a title.  The meme is then displayed on the feeds of anyone who follows the user.
